            <p><a href ="https://www.nps.gov/noca/index.htm" target ="_blank" >North Cascades National Park </a>is an 
                American national park in the state of Washington. It consists of a northern and southern section, 
                bisected by the Skagit River that flows through Ross Lake National Recreation Area. North Cascades 
                National Park features the rugged mountain peaks of the North Cascades Range, the most expansive 
                glacial system in the contiguous United States, the headwaters of numerous waterways, and vast 
                forests with the highest degree of flora biodiversity of any American national park. 
                The North Cascades National Park Complex has some of the best hiking trails in 
                Washington State.

                <p><a href ="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/washington/maple-pass-trail" target ="_blank" >The Maple Pass 
                    Loop Trail</a> is known as a classic, five-star route in Washington's North Cascades. 
                    The trail is incredibly diverse, and features talus fields, old-growth forest, open ridges colored with wildflowers 
                    and spectacular views of North Cascade peaks: from nearby Corteo and Black to Glacier in the distance.

                    <a href ="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/washington/cascade-pass-trail--3" target ="_blank" >The Cascade Pass Trail </a> 
                        is a stunning hike with views of peaks and glaciers. The trail rises steadily to the pass, from which hikers may explore 
                        in several directions. The Cascade Pass Trail is also a popular starting point for climbing routes to Sahale, Boston, Mixup, 
                        and Magic Peaks, and the Ptarmigan Traverse into the Glacier Peak Wilderness. The trail switchbacks through dense, wet forests 
                        then traverses through meadows to the pass.

                    <a href ="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/washington/hidden-lake-lookout-trail" target ="_blank" >Hidden Lake Lookout </a> 
                    is a strenuous, 9-mile round trip day hike with 3,290 feet of elevation gain in North Cascade National Park. The trail climbs 
                    steeply and steadily up wildflower meadows to a lookout with views of the major Cascade Range peaks. The path to the Hidden Lake 
                    Lookout starts out in dense forest along and occasionally through and over runoff streams. Then it transitions to the meadows, and steep rocky slopes.
                    Many people think of the lookout as a camping shelter, and it is in fact available on a first-come, first-serve basis.
